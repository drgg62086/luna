# [Proposal] - speed up the burning by launch multi-person online collaborative painting activities(like reddit's r/place) regularly and cast the result of each painting activities as an nft

(Introduction about "r/place" : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place)

this activity may require the development of some DAPP,
or just create a smart contract that everyone can send a little luna to this address to modify some pixel color

And then,here can set up two modes:  
'free mode' or 'auction mode'

in 'free mode',It’s will be the same as r/place(The cooling time can be shorter than 5 minutes,it depends on the speed of transaction)

but in 'Auction mode' , if someone want to modify a pixel that has been modified by others, they need to consume more luna than others

Either way,at the end of time, the canvas will automatically be cast as an NFT to auction, and the auction proceeds (Including the bonus on every trade after that) are used partly buy luna for burning and partly for distribution according to the last modifier to each pixel on the canvas,this will encourages people to get involved 

if it works well, and taking advantage of the popularity of luna + the possibility of '0.00001 to 100' + the special cast NFT mode that no one’s ever tried before, 
that should attract a lot of participants, more and more popularity , and speed up the burning of UST and Luna more and more fast

and even if the final NFT can be bid an incredible price(the price is based in luna and trade is also in luna),
reach the $100 goal also is not impossible
**(All it takes is to attract enough people to participate in painting activities and attract a large number of current luna owners to bid for the NFT, and Luna can be burning in a short period of time,Without incurring too much external cost)**

-----------------------------------------------------

## notes:

Using blockchain to realize 'r/place' activities will be a simple design

user just need to send funds to a smart contract , it is equivalent to modifying a pixel

and the nft will not need image file ,Because previous transaction is already contains all the RBG data

 If you think this is a good ideal, please retweet it or start a crowdfunding campaign on Gitcoin, and I’m willing to pay a little money for it.
 Or if you have a better idea, please send a email to me :  drgg62086@gmail.com
