# [Proposal] - speed up the burning by launch multi-person online collaborative painting activities(like "r/place") and cast the painting result as an nft

this activity may require the development of some DAPP,
or just create a smart contract that everyone can send a little luna to this address to modify specific pixel color

And then,here can set up two modes:
'free mode' and 'auction mode'

in 'free mode',It’s will be the same as r/place(The cooling time can be shorter than 5 minutes)

but in 'Auction mode' , if someone want to modify a pixel that has been modified by others, they need to consume more luna than others

Either way,at the end of time , the canvas will automatically be cast as an NFT to auction, and the auction proceeds should automatically split in two part,
one part used to buy luna and burning, and the other part should assigned to the last modifier of each pixel on the canvas(including the bonus on every trade after that),this will encourages people to get involved 

if this works well, and taking advantage of the popularity of the community, and the possibility of '0.00001 to 100', and the special cast NFT mode that no one’s ever tried before, 
that should attract a lot of participants, more and more popularity , and speed up the burning of UST and Luna more and more fast

...  

and maybe, this could even create a new mining model:"place" to earn?
