# [Proposal] - speed up the burning by launch a multi-person online collaborative painting activities(like "r/place") and cast the painting result as an nft

this activity may require the development of some DAPP,
or just create a smart contract that everyone can send a little luna to this address to modify specific pixel color,

And then,here can set up two modes:
'free mode' and 'auction mode'

in 'free mode',It’s will be the same as r/place

but in 'Auction mode' , if someone want to modify a pixel that has been modified by others, they need to consume more luna than others

Either way,at the end of time, the canvas will automatically be cast as an NFT , and the auction proceeds are used partly buy luna for burning and partly for distribution according to the last modifier to each pixel on the canvas

If this activities worked well, it may speed up the burning of UST and Luna

...

and If it works, it could even be seen as a new mode of mining, “Place to earn”
