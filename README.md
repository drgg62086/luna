# [Proposal] - speed up the burning by developing a Multi-person online collaborative painting game using a forked coin that supports unlimited issuance as 'pigment' and cast the painting result as an nft

this game will looks like Sandbox’s land auction + REDDIT’s r/place canvas

for example:

Original Luna holders can consume Luna to launch a canvas that lasts for several minutes or several hours

and they can select 'singleplayer mode' or 'Multiplayer mode'.

in 'Multiplayer mode',Everyone can modify pixels by consume the "forked coin"(not governance coin),

But if someone want to modify a pixel that has been modified by others, he need to consume more "forked coin" than others,like Sandbox’s land auction

Therefore, if player want the "pigment" to become cheaper, they need to constantly consume ust casting forked coin, make its total supply more and more, and make its price lower and lower in the exchange,
So as to get more and cheaper pigments and 'bid' with others.

Finally, at the end of time, the canvas will automatically be cast as an NFT and will be auctioned by the auction house in the terra system  

The auction proceeds are allocated according to the last modifier for each pixel on the canvas
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the whole process, UST can only be cast as "forked coin", Not Original Luna,  and Original Luna can be cast as UST or "forked coin"

only when the marketcap of Original luna > 200% marketcap of UST , UST can be cast as Original Luna
 
If this game worked well, it may speed up the burning of UST and Luna

and If it works, it could even be seen as a new mode of mining, “Place”to earn
